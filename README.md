# -Welcome to the 'Contact Management System'- 
## -Here i'll explain, step by step, how everything works-
### -The system will begin by showing you the menu with all the tasks avalible-

Function 1. (Adding a contact)\n 
-Enter a new contact into the system 
-Ensure you enter your email in the correct email format, otherwise it will not accept your input. Same goes for the phone number prompt
-Once entered, you will recieve a message stating the successful creation of your contact
Function 2. (Editing a contact) 
-The system will prompt for an email to search for an existing contact (again, must be in the right format) if it does not exist,
it will simply let you know that it does not exist and you can put in another email
-Once you've found the contact you're looking for, the system will go through every detail in the contact. If you don't wish to change that 
particular detail, just hit enter(Leave it blank) and it will not change
-When you are finished, it will show you the new contact information and a success message
Function 3. (Deleting A contact)
-First, the system will prompt for an email to find the contact you wish to delete
