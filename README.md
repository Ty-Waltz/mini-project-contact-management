# -Welcome to the 'Contact Management System'- 
## -Here i'll explain, step by step, how everything works-
### -The system will begin by showing you the menu with all the tasks available-

### Function 1. (Adding a contact)   
-Enter a new contact into the system     
-Ensure you enter your email in the correct email format, otherwise it will not accept your input. Same goes for the phone number prompt  
-Once entered, you will recieve a message stating the successful creation of your contact  
### Function 2. (Editing a contact)  
-The system will prompt for an email to search for an existing contact (again, must be in the right format) if it does not exist,  
it will simply let you know that it does not exist and you can put in another email  
-Once you've found the contact you're looking for, the system will go through every detail in the contact. If you don't wish to change that  
particular detail, just hit enter(Leave it blank) and it will not change  
-When you are finished, it will show you the new contact information and a success message  
### Function 3. (Deleting A contact)   
-First, the system will prompt for an email to find the contact you wish to delete    
-After that, it will confirm that you are deleting the correct contact  
-Once you are finished, you will be displayed a success message or a canceled message depending on your choice  
-If the contact does not exist, it will let you know it does not exist and prompt you for another email  
### Function 4. (Search for contact)
-In the main code, you will search for contacts by email  
-Once entered, you will be displayed the contact's email and the details within the contact  
-If the contact does not exist, the system will let you know it does not exist  
*In the bonus code, you can search up contacts using any detail within the contact*  
### Function 5. (Display all contact)
-This function will display all available contacts in the system's database
### Function 6. (Export contacts to a .txt file)  
-This function will prompt you to export the current data within the management system into a .txt file  
-If the file does not exist already, it will create one for you  
-Once complete, you will get a success message  
### Function 7. (Import from .txt file)
-This will prompt you to type in a file you would like to view
-If a file name is that you input does not exist the system will let you know it does not exist
